 @abstract An object in the loaded hierarchy of a preview.
 @discussion NPPreviewBuilder loads NPObject's from the description given by ibtool. Each NPObject corresponds to one loadable object from the description of the nib file. The hierarchies of both object trees match: a child of a NPObject (again a NPObject) maps to a child of the original of the same object.
