 @const BLParagraphSegmentation		Strings are split by paragraphs, namely newline characters.
 @const BLSentenceSegmentation		Strings are split by sentcences, denoted by punctuation characters.
 @const BLWordSegmentation			Strings are split by words, delimited by whitespace characters. Words DO include punctuation characters such as sentence marks. If you do not want this binding, use BLDetailedSegmentation.
 @const BLDetailedSegmentation		Strings are split by detailled words. This is similar to BLWordSegmentation, except that punctuation characters are separate segments.

The first delimiter is sequence of leading characters that were dropped, the last on the trailing part. Inbetween, the i-th segment was split from the (i+1)-th one by the (i+1)-th delimiter.
