 @abstract Splits a key object into multiple key objects representing the segments.
 @discussion This only happens, if the object needs to be split (i.e. has multiple segments) and can be split. Especially the last point is important - if the segemtnations between all localizations do not match, splitting is not possible. In this case, this method returns only the array containing the original. Also the key object must be a BLStringKeyObject or similar, storing NSString objects.
