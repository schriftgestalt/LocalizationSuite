    <td><p><span class="text">- There's no need to update the localization database every time you change the interface. Just work on your project as long as it takes and when you achieved a state where there will be no more or just very few changes to be done to the interface you start your work on the localization. Localizer files just have to be created when you want to change something or to send them to your translator.</span></p>
    <p><span class="text">- You might also find the &quot;updated&quot; and &quot;active&quot; key
      flags useful. They can be set/unset in the file details windowdow (see
      section <a href="#2.3">2.3</a>). Using the "active" flag you can deactivate
      several keys that don't have to be localized (e.g. patterns, URLs or date
      formaters). The "updated" flag might also be helpful for your localizers
      to get the job done. Localizer will read "updated" flags as "changed",
      making it easy to find the updated sections. You might find it useful
      that the "updated" flag is  set automatically when using "Update Files" and
      there have been changes. Also notice that you have to uncheck it manually.
      It's suggested to uncheck after importing all .loc files or after a release
      (which should be nearly the same). </span></p>
